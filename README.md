## FTL Crops (Fixed(Again))

#### Credit goes to Avatar Innuendo for their original mod - [FTL Crops](https://pages.github.com/).

### Usage and precautions!
* It's probably fine to use this mod with other vanila FTL Crops versions, but since they are weird and I don't understand why they were done like this - do not push your luck. It won't crush your game, crops just won't grow as fast, as it's coded here.
* FTL Crops specifically designed for different mods are probably fine, but you wouldn't know without unpacking their content.pak file, and i didn't bother cheking them out.

The previous modder of [FTL Crops (Fixed)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=910447187) said that they were "*in the process of adding FU plants in (it's taking a while, lol, so many plants)*". 

It has been three years now since that, and, seeing the fact that even the base plants weren't implemented correctly (or something else went horribly wrong), I went ahead and fixed FU and vanilla crops myself in one sitting.

Sadly, patch-logic here isn't automated, all plants are changed with the same code over and over again, but all that is just in different folders, corresponding to the plants names. Previous mod version were littered with missing or mismatched files, which is complitely bizzaring for me, why would you put .PNG-file in folder and forget to place there an actual .patch. 

I was really annoyed with some other modders, who said they wouldn't update their "FTL Crops"-mod versions to support FU-plants, so each one was missing something, transforming my mod folder into a Ship of Theseus of sorts for fast growing crops. 

And so I spent around two hours proofreading other peoples work to fix things this time (but not for long though, since it looks like that in the last three years FU added some more plants and no one bothered with updates, so this one's gonna get outdated too, sooner or later, if there will be new updates to the plant roster). Currently I have no plans to update this mod if FU-creators decide to add more crops, and I don't like the idea of making this mod via normal code and not that weird folder-switcheroo, automating the whole process. Instead, I better do things so I don't ever need to use "FTL Crops".

FU is the reason why I play StarBound and I just don't like to be on the edge of my seat all the time in playthrough, thinking about things like "*but I need to gather plants, but I can't automate it, but other way is either to grind on the same planet or farm on the ship, or relocate entire farm from planet to planet, or these weird trays, or to go full extraction machinery with extracting everything I see*".

After this project I want to focus on possibilities for an alternative system of extraction devices (and other related automation). Maybe even experimenting with the same code that was used for crops cycle updates or even coming up with my own solution if I'll have one. Anyway, I'll update this description later, if there's any progress being done with that idea. For me, it's the only reason to even use FTL-like mods for crops farming, so that a new approach for automation would solve so much issues for me that I have with gameplay-loop (it's actually really good, but it's annoyingly not-perfect).
