## FTL Crops (Fixed(Again))

#### Credit goes to Avatar Innuendo for their original mod - [FTL Crops](https://pages.github.com/).

The previous modder of [FTL Crops (Fixed)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=910447187) said that they were "*in the process of adding FU plants in (it's taking a while, lol, so many plants)*". It has been three years now since their publication of this mod, and, seeing that even the base plants weren't implemented correctly, I went and fixed FU and vanilla crops myself in one sitting.

Sadly, the logic here isn't automated, all plants are patched with the same code over and over again in different folders, and the previous mod version were littered with missing or mismatched files. I was getting annoyed by other modders, who said they wouldn't update their "FTL Crops"-versions to support FU-plants, so I spent around two hours proofreading other peoples work to fix things this time (but not for long, since it looks like that in the last three years FU added some more plants and no one bothered with updates).

Currently I have no more plans to update this mod if FU-creators decide to add more crops, and I don't have plans or any idea how to make this via normal code and not that weird folder-switcheroo.

FU is the reason why I play this game and I just don't like to be on the edge of my seat, thinking about "I need to gather plants, but I can't automate it, but other way is either to grind on the same planet or farm on the ship, or these weird trays, or to go full extraction machinery, which is even worse for me"./n/nAfter this mod I want to focus on alternative system for extraction devices and other automation, experimenting with the same code that was used for crops cycle updates or even coming up with my own solution if I have one. I'll update this description later, if there's any progress being done with that project. For me, it's the only reason to even use FTL-like mods for crops farming, so dealing with that would solve so much issues I have with games cycle (it's really good, but it's just but this much on the verge of perfection).
